## Description
WOPR Console is a spoof of the War Operations Plan Response from the 1983 movie WarGames. I've designed it to imitate the original WOPR as much as possible with more plans in the future.

This simulator works for Windows 10, macOS, and Linux. It may require ```sudo chmod +x``` to run.
